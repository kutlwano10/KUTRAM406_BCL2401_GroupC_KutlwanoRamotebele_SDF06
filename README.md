i Learned alot about CSS ,and also how Instagram layout was created .It was a bit overwhelming working with grid and flexbox.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I feel confident using grid, using margins and styling my web page.
- **Responsive Design**: i'm still learning more on the responsive designs but so far i'm good with desktop
- **Styling Elements**: styling alot of properties like img, sections where a bit challenging 

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I need to look more into responsive design because i'm very confused
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: i still need to look into hovers and focus effects it was very challenging to work with them more especially when i had to make the front of the images blurry and put content on top of them.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I need to work on responsive designs, hovers, focus, and other css properties because my codes sometimes dont work and its hard to find errors.
- **Code Optimization**:  i  really enjoy to see when the code respond well, i  need to improve more on understanding how to comment my code and improve my coding style to make it more easier to understand.
- **Creative Design Choices**: i think i need to work on more layouts to understand where to apply some of the css properties.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This Project helped me to understand more of css and where and how to apply certain properties and where not to apply them. I had a bit of understanding about.
